Modified by Lenso contributors:

- Replaced HeroUI packages, Tailwind/BEM styling and global React Aria assumptions
  with actual `@lenso/ui` / `@lenso/tokens` contracts, StyleX and native ownership.
- Replaced network fetch scripts and mutable upstream fallback with the existing
  version/digest-matched Lenso CLI/MCP and authored source contract.
- Added progressive component, theme and setup references, explicit tooling
  availability, and repository/consumer verification distinctions.
- Linked a separate first-party Lenso visual-design workflow. That workflow is
  not a copied HeroUI Pro template or a claimed upstream design skill.

Upstream installation and public archive discovery are reference mechanisms,
not currently implemented Lenso installation endpoints. These workflows remain
source-candidate skills loaded through the agent host.
